# Day 5 – Python Loops

## Project: Password Genrato

## Project Description
This project is a Python-based password generator that creates a strong,
random password based on user-defined criteria. The user selects how many
letters, symbols, and numbers to include, and the program generates a
shuffled password.

## Concepts Learned
- `for` loops
- Lists
- Random module
- String manipulation
- "".join()
- append()
- range()
- shuffled() 

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
