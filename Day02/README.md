# Day 2 – Data Types & String Manipulation

## Project: Tip Calculator
This project is a Python-based Tip Calculator that helps users calculate the final amount each person should pay when splitting a bill. The program takes the total bill amount, desired tip percentage, and number of people as input, then outputs the amount each person needs to contribute.


## Project Description
This program collects user input and displays formatted output.
It focuses on understanding how data is stored and manipulated in Python.

## Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to solve real-life
problems involving calculations and user interaction, making it a strong
foundation for more complex applications later in the course.


## Concepts Learned
- Primitive Data types
- Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion
- NUmber Manipulation and f-strings in Pyhton

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
